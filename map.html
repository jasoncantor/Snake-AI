            By the dawn of the 3rd Century CE, Rome's territorial control was at its height. However, political and social tensions would make this a turbulent century for the empire. In just over 50 years, the Empire would see the rise and fall of more than 20 emperors, most of whom were assassinated. These murders were often conducted by members of the emperor's body guard, showing the weakness and corruption within the government. During this time, the empire was also broken into 3: The Gallic Empire in the north, the Roman Empire based in Italy, and the Palmyrene Empire in the modern-day Middle East.

Emperor Diocletian was born in 245 CE in the Balkan province of Dalmatia. He gained power by rising through the military ranks. While there is some evidence that he may have played a role in the death of his predecessor Numerian, Diocletian was able to solidify power by 284 CE. One of Diocletian's legacies was his decision to divide the Empire into 2 halves: The Eastern and Western Empires. He also changed the governing structure of Rome to the Tetrarchy. In this system, each Empire would have 1 Emperor, also called Augustus. There would also be a second in command, called the Caesar, who would take over power when the emperor died or abdicated. Diocletian believed this system would help solve the violence and chaos that often followed the succession of an emperor.

In 284 CE, Emperor Diocletian split the Roman Empire into two halves. The Western Empire was seated in Milan while the Eastern Empire's capital was Byzantium, later known as Constantinople. Diocletian believed this would make the empire easier to govern, which it did in the short term. However, as time went on, the two halves drifted further apart and led to some of the problems that caused the decline of the Western Empire.

Emperor Constantine was born sometime between 272 and 285 CE in modern day Serbia. His father was the Caesar for the west, so Constantine grew up in the imperial court, eventually serving as a high ranking staff officer for Diocletian. In May of 305, Diocletian and Maximian both abdicated their thrones, and did not give power over to Constantine. He would not forget this betrayal, and focused in the coming years on building up his military experience. Ultimately Constantine secured his power and support during the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 CE. It was during this battle that Constantine also had a conversion experience and embraced Christianity, which would have profound impacts for the Roman Empire.

Early Christians in the Roman Empire faced tremendous persecution. Of particular note was the persecution and execution of Jesus's disciples and their followers, which was often ordered by the emperor. Despite the threat of violence, Christianity continued to grow within the Roman Emperor. It was Constantine that ultimately embraced the religion, issuing the Edict of Milan in 313 CE which ended their persecution. This was followed by the development of the Nicene Creed in 335 CE, which outlined the core beliefs of Christians and the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire in 380 CE.

In 410 CE, the Gothic King Alaric accomplished something that hadn't been done in over 8 centuries: successfully attack and invade the city of Rome. The Visigoths destroyed pagan statues, the Senate building, and pillaged the city of many of its resources and valuables. While the city and empire would survive, this marked a serious blow to the empire. The Visigoths did not stay in Rome, but rather found a permanent home in Gaul following the sack of Rome.
The Huns, a group of Eurasian fighters under the control of Attila, began to invade Northern Europe in the 440's CE. This would cause the mass migration of Germanic tribes into Roman Territory. The migration of these tribes led to tensions with the Roman Army, such as with the Visigoths and Vandals.

The Vandals were a Germanic Tribe that had been fighting the Romans on the frontiers since the 1st century CE. In 429, the Vandals led a successful campaign from Spain into Roman North Africa, ultimately taking over land from Morocco to Carthage. This was significant because it disrupted trade routes and challenged Roman control of the Mediterranean.
        </p><p>
From their new vantage point in Carthage, the Vandals staged a successful attack on Rome in 445 AD. Rome understood that its army would fall to the Vandals, so they sent Pope Leo I to negotiate with the Vandals. The Vandals would be able to take anything they wanted from the city, but they would not destroy the city and would leave its inhabitants alone. The Vandals honored this agreement, pillaging the city of its valuables and resources, but kept the city intact and its inhabitants free.

After surviving the invasions by the Visigoths and the Vandals, Rome was significantly weakened. The collapse of the Western Empire would come with the invasion of another Germanic tribe led by Odoacer, who staged a revolt that killed the last Emperor Romulus. From that point on, no Roman emperor would rule from a post in Italy, effectively ending the Empire.
In 330 CE, Emperor Constantine moves the Roman capital to Constantinople, known as Istanbul in modern-day Turkey. This move signaled the decline of Rome as the center of the empire. Emperors like Constantine make sure that Constantinople was fortified and well guarded. This meant that less money and resources were sent to Rome and the Western Empire, ultimately making it more vulnerable.

In 378 CE, the Goths were threatened by the Huns to the North, so they moved into Roman territory and were closing in on Constantinople. They even killed the Eastern Emperor Valens during the Battle of Adrianople. This led to the Eastern Empire making a truce with the Goths, which ultimately helped the East but had disastrous consequences for the West. After the truce, the Goths then turned their attention to Rome, leading to the successful sacking of the city in 410 CE.
After the truce with the Goths, the Eastern Empire, which was remained the Byzantine Empire after the collapse of the West in 476 CE, became a successful and powerful player on the world stage. The Empire included territories ranging from lands in Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Levant, to Asia Minor and parts of North Africa. The Empire was a Christian state and the official language was Greek. The Byzantines developed their own political systems, religious practices, art and architecture. While the Romans significantly influenced the cultural tradition, the Byzantines were distinct and not merely a continuation of ancient Rome. The Byzantine Empire lasted until 1453, when it was conquered by the Ottomans and became a part of the Ottoman Empire.
